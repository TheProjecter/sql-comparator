SQL Comparator is a C# Windows application designed to facilitate rapid minimal change database validation, which is capable of connecting to any ODBC compliant data source such as Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle.

SQL Comparator runs two user defined queries and compares the results in a graphical mode designed to facilitate the identification of minimal differences in complex tables.  The tool will calculate and highlight any row, column, and cell-based differences between the two datasets.  The tabular data is displayed in two datagrids which are positionally synchronized and where differing cells are visually highlighted.
